# Segmentation_Project

_This code is essentially forked from the following work:_

Usiigaci: Label-free instance-aware cell tracking in phase contrast microscopy enabled by machine learning
Hsieh-Fu Tsai<sup>1,2</sup>, Joanna Gajda<sup>3</sup>, Tyler F.W. Sloan<sup>4</sup>, Andrei Rares<sup>5</sup>, and Amy Q. Shen<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup>Micro/Bio/Nanofluidics Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University, Okinawa Japan 

<sup>2</sup>Research Fellow of Japan Society of Promotion for Science

<sup>3</sup>AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland

<sup>4</sup>Quorumetrix Solutions, Canada

<sup>5</sup>ImagineA, The Netherlands

_And adapted for 2p calcium imaging. The main changes are_
* Added processing of 2p movies into single frames for initial segmentation
* Added code to extract signals from movies following segmentation by the network
